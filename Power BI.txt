Power BI - It is a Business Intelligence tool which helps the End Users to get meaningful insigts of the data

It has 4 components :
1. Power Query - Used for ETL, Cleaning of the data before loading or after loading as well
2. Power Pivot - Used for Modelling and Building relationships between different tables
3. Power View - Used for creating visualizations and Dashboards
4. Power BI Service - Used to publish and share the report with teams or different Users

Charts :
1. Column Chart - A Column Chart is a chart where data is presented vertically. (If you don't pass legend it will be a simple column chart)
		  It is a chart where the data is represented based on a particular factor
		  For Ex : If you pass Categories in the Axis and Sales in the Values
			   Then it shows the Sales Amount per Category - It shows how much Sales has happened for each Category
2. Stacked Column Chart - A Stacked Column chart is something where we show the data with divisions on some parameter based on a particular factor (Legend
		  is passed in order to make it a Stacked Column Chart)
		  For Ex : If you pass Categories in the Axis, Sales in the Values and Geography in the legend
			   Then it shows the Sales Amount per Category and shows the division of the Geography in the column itself
			   How much Sales has happened in different Regions for each Category
3. Pie Chart - It is a chart which is basically used to showcase part to whole relationship. It is usually good practice to show disctribution for 
	       a factor which has less than 6 - 7 items.
	       For Ex : If you pass Geography to the Legend and Sales in the Value, then it will show Sales Distribution across all geographies
4. Doughnut Chart - It is a chart which is also used to showcase part to whole relationship but here you get a hole in the middle and thus instead of 
		    slices you will be showing an arc representing the value. If you have less elements to show then Doughnut charts can be used but 
		    if you have relatively more elements then it is better to go for a Pie chart
5. Funnel Chart - It is a chart which is used to show the filtered data in different stages
		  For Ex : The Hiring process. Here you can show how many of the Candidates applied for the exam, how many appeared, how many cleared,
			   how many candidates hired. So the data will be represented as if it is flowing though a funnel filtered through different stages
6. Ribbon Chart - It is a chart which is used to display highest rank category over a period of time. The highest rank category always stays at the top
		  and the other Categories takes the position depending on the rank in each time period.
		  NOTE : For Ribbon Charts, it is mandatory to pass the legend based on which the ribbon is created. If it is not passed then it becomes
			 a simple column chart
7. Map - It is used to show a geographical location and for that the Data Category of the field has to be appropriate. It has to be either Address, City, 
	 State or Province, Country, Postal code, Latitude, Longitude etc.
8. Filled Map - It is also used to show a geographical location filled with colours to separate the other locations.
9. Map with Pie Chart - It is just a plain Map where the bubbles turns into a Pie if the Category dropped in the legend has values spread across all
			Geographies. It is a default behaviour which exists in the Map itself. This type of information cannot be shown using Filled Maps.
			NOTE : The distribution in the Pie will be equal in every geo since the measure is not given in the visual yet. Once you drop a 
			       measure say - "Sales" into Size, then you will see the slices appropriately. It creates the Pie based on the Sale Value
			       in different regions.
10. Table - Table is a visual where you can show data in a tabular format. This visual doesnot have anything other than Values and so whatever you drag and
	    drop into Values will be shown in the table. Sorting can be done from the elipses button of the Visual itself.
11. Matrix - Matrix is a visual which is used to show data in 2 dimentional format. For ex - Lets say we have many sub-categories and the sales for all of
	     those sub-categories are given for 4 diferent regions. If you try to present this kind of data in Table, then each sub-category will repeat 4
	     times because of the 4 regions for each sub-category and hense Matrix comes into picture which will help to represent the data in a much
	     better way. In Matrix we have 3 Fields - Row, Column & Values.
12. Line Chart - Line chart is a simple chart which is used to show the trend or progress over time. Whatever you throw in the Axis will come in the X-Axis
		 and whatever you throw in the Value will come in Y-Axis and the line is shown to present the trend
13. Area Chart - Area Chart is very similar to Line Chart. It highlights the area under the line to give insights saying how much area is covered by a
		 particular legend value.
14. Line VS Column Chart - There are two types of this type of combo Chart : (This type of chart has SharedAxis, ColumnValues, LineValues and ColumnSeries)
			   This type of chart takes two measures and can be analysed by two different dimentions. Here we get a secondary axis for the line
			   1> Line VS Clustered Cloumn - Once you drop a legend in the ColumnSeries, you will see that the each column has been splitted
							 into multiple Sub-Columns and you can analyse for a particular year
			   2> Line VS Stacked Column - Here we compare between the years
15. Scatter Plot - It is the only default visual which has an animation property in it. There are other charts as well which has animations but they are
		   not included by default. It is used to see the distribution. 2 measures are mandatorily required in order to use this chart. Now, you
		   just have to drop a dimention in the details field in order to see the distribution of that dimention. There is a field called Size 
		   which can be used to see the volume as it increases or decreases the size based on the distribution. Finally it also has a Play Axis
		   where basically you want to drop a date field so that it can show the change in distribution with time. There is a legend field as well
		   to categorize the data that you want to see in the distribution. Once you have dropped a date, you can select one of the items and see
		   the trend as well. A line is drawn for the selected items, to show the trend

Formating - We can do formatting in each and every visual by going inside the Format menu (looks like a paint brush)

Include & Exclude - It is used to filter the values visually from the screen and compare the sales between two different categories. This gets added into
		    the Filters pane so it is basically like adding visual level filter from the Filters pane.

View Data & Export - It is a functionality of Power BI where we can filter a visual and the details of the filtered part can be seen record by record. We 
		     don't have to filter it manually as we do it in excel. And that filtered data is then can be export very easily by clicking at end 
		     (...) button. Once you click the button you will get option to export the detials in a CSV. This permission to allow the end user to
		     export the filtered data can be selected from the Report setting under CURRENT FILE

Conditional Formatting - Conditional Formatting is a Feature present in the Table & Matrix Chart using which we can do Formatting based on a certain
			 condition. The Backgroud or Foreground Colour will change based on the Values, we can add icons and also Bars based on values.
			 We can also set custom rules as per our requirement and format the table accordingly.

Aggregations - Whenever we drop a numeric column in the field of a table, by default it shows the summation values (it is aggregated by default with sum)
	       We can change the aggregation by just right clicking on the numeric field from the field list and choose the desired aggregation. We can 
	       also show the values in percentage

Hirearchies - These are levels that are dependent on each other in someway and can be drilled down to see the details for each and every level. In Power BI
	      whenever you drop a date field it takes the date as a Hirearchy by default (you can change it back to original date format as well) and for
	      other fields you just have to drag and drop the field over the field for which you want to create the Hirearchy. These are easily created in
	      Matrix. If you drop more than one field in the Row or Column, it takes it as Hirearchy and so there can be levels created in both Row & Column
	      end in the Matrix and then if you want to drill down and go into the next level you have to select which way you want to drill first because
	      expansion of the levels is only possible in one way so it has to be either in the Row side or the Column side

Totals & Sub-Totals - In Matrix, it is very easy to turn on & off the Totals and Sub-Totals part because those are present as an option under the Format
		      section itself. We can change the colour size and other things from the same option.
