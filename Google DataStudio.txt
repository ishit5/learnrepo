Google DataStudio is a free BI tool which helps to create interactive reports and dashboards for the end user

Limitations of Google Data Studio :
1. Limited support to join data - Only supports Left join and supports join with only 4 data sources
2. Limited configuration of charts
3. Limited auto refresh of data
4. Data in public domain - Have to be very careful since it is very easy to leak the data to the public
5. Limited functioning of the filters

To connect to Data Source - Click on Create -> Data Source (Here you will get a lot of data sources to connect to and also many 3rd party tools)

Themes and Layout - A pre-defined theme and report level layout setting can be done

Text and Images :
Text can be inserted and they can also be hyperlinked to a different page or a different report altogether
Images can be uploaded to the report either from your local or you can provide a link for the image

Bullet Charts :
This is a special type of chart, where you need to show if the target is achieved or not
Here the thing to note is the ranges and the target that you want to show in the chart has to be provided manually

Data Sources :
Multiple data sources can be connected to one report
You can see and manage all your data sources from Resource option and from there one needs to select "Manage added data sources"
You will also get a separate "Data sources" tab when in Data Studio home page. You will be able to see all the data sources used

Blending Data Sources :
Blending means joining multiple data sources together on the basis of a common column
Blending multiple data sources is possible in Data Studio but you can have maximum of 5 sources joined together
Also a point to note here is that all the joining that you do in Data Studio are all Left joined

Scheduling Data Refresh :
This can be done by editing an existing Data Source and then selecting the desired refresh rate
The fastest that Data Studio allows is refresh rate of 1 min
Data Studio only pulls the refreshed data only if there is a change in the Source and this is done to prevent additional costing

Sharing Reports/Dashboards & Data Sources :
Both Report and Data Source can be shared independently
You can give view or edit access while sharing and this will determine the scope of things that can be done by the one with which it is shared
You can also restrict sharing the reports further who has been given edit access and you can also disable downloading, printing and copying for viewers

Running Calculations :
Running calculations can be easily done in Data Studio since it has a separate option that you get when you edit the metric
You can do - Running Sum, Running Max, Running Min, Running Count, Runing Average, Running Delta
** Running Delta : It is nothing but the amount increased or decreased from the previous value

Comparision Calculations :
Similar to running calculations, we also have comparision calculations which you can get by editing the metric
It has two options : Either you can compare relative to corresponding data or relative to base data

Page Settings :
You can have one or multiple pages under a report and there are few page level setting that can be done
There is entirely a separate option present for managing pages

Versioning :
Data Studio keeps versioning of the reports by default
Additionally, you can also give a name to the current as well as older versions of the report
You can check all the versions at once and you can make an older version as current version and start working on that as well
The option for versioning can be found in the File option
